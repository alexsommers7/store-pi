## Database Interaction

All endpoints act as real-world endpoints, but without actually writing anything to the database. In the event that you are creating or updating a resource, the response will still contain the updated data despite not persisting it.

## CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing is enabled for all incoming requests.

## Authorization

Certain requests require a JWT for authorization. Requests that do require the token are indicated as such by the icon. As a general rule, any REST or GraphQL request that is reading or writing to a current user's resources will require the bearer token.

For REST calls, a token can be obtained via the log in endpoint. For GraphQL calls, you can obtain a token via the login mutation. In both situations, the token will be returned in the response body and will be valid for 90 days.

## GraphQL

StorePI includes a GraphQL API powered by Apollo Server, offering compatibility with any GraphQL client, including the popular Apollo Client.

Every request has its equivalent GraphQL query/mutation accessible at https://storepi.herokuapp.com/graphql. You may pass in the same query parameters as REST calls, with the exception of fields.

To explore and test all available queries and mutations, visit the [Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer/?endpoint=https://storepi.herokuapp.com/graphql).
